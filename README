NM-cpp: Numerical methods library for C++.

Description: This is mostly a personal project to implement numerical methods into C++, but feel free to use and contribute. Initially started in 2018. Currently re-working and preparing to add more capability. 
    
Tools: Root finding algorithms (bisection, secant method, regula-falsi, Newton-Raphson, cubic Halley). Solutions to ODEs (Runge Kutta 4th order).
